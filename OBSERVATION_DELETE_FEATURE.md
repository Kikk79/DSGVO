# Delete Observation Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Delete Observation feature provides GDPR-compliant functionality to delete individual observations from the system. This feature implements proper security controls, data integrity validation, and user confirmation workflows to ensure safe and compliant data deletion.

## Architecture

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Layer (`src-tauri/src/database.rs`)

**New Methods:**

1. **`delete_observation(observation_id, author_id, force_delete)`**
   - **Purpose**: Safely delete an observation with authorization checks
   - **Parameters**:
     - `observation_id: i64` - Unique identifier of the observation
     - `author_id: i64` - ID of the user requesting deletion
     - `force_delete: bool` - Administrative override flag
   - **Security Features**:
     - Author verification (only observation creator can delete)
     - Administrative override with `force_delete` flag
     - Cascading deletion of attachments (GDPR compliance)
     - Transaction safety with proper error handling

2. **`get_observation(observation_id)`**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve a single observation by ID
   - **Parameters**: `observation_id: i64`
   - **Returns**: `Option<Observation>` - The observation if found, None if not
   - **Security**: Decrypts observation text using system crypto manager

#### API Layer (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`)

**New Tauri Commands:**

1. **`delete_observation`**
   - **Endpoint**: Accessible from frontend via `invoke('delete_observation', params)`
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `observation_id: i64`
     - `force_delete: Option<bool>` (defaults to false)
   - **Security**: Uses hardcoded `author_id = 1` (should be replaced with actual user session)
   - **Audit Logging**: Logs all deletion attempts with operation type

2. **`get_observation`**
   - **Endpoint**: Accessible from frontend via `invoke('get_observation', params)`
   - **Parameters**: `observation_id: i64`
   - **Returns**: Single observation or null if not found

### Frontend Implementation

#### State Management (`src/stores/appStore.ts`)

**New Store Methods:**

1. **`deleteObservation(observation_id, force_delete?)`**
   - **Purpose**: Delete observation and update local state
   - **Features**:
     - Calls backend API
     - Optimistic UI updates (removes from local state immediately)
     - Proper error handling and state management
   - **Parameters**:
     - `observation_id: number`
     - `force_delete?: boolean` (optional, defaults to false)

2. **`getObservation(observation_id)`**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve single observation details
   - **Returns**: `Promise<Observation | null>`
   - **Use Case**: Pre-deletion verification or detailed views

#### User Interface (`src/components/StudentSearch.tsx`)

**Enhanced StudentSearch Component:**

1. **Delete Button Integration**
   - Red trash icon button next to export options
   - Hover states with proper accessibility
   - Click triggers confirmation dialog

2. **Confirmation Dialog**
   - **Safety Features**:
     - Clear warning message about irreversible action
     - Student name confirmation
     - Two-step process (confirm → execute)
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Displays backend error messages
     - Offers "Force Delete" option for administrative override
     - Proper loading states during deletion

3. **User Experience**
   - Immediate visual feedback on successful deletion
   - Graceful error handling with actionable options
   - Accessible dialog with proper ARIA labels

## Security & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

1. **Right to Erasure**: Complete data removal including encrypted content
2. **Cascading Deletion**: Automatic removal of related attachments
3. **Audit Trail**: All deletion attempts are logged for compliance
4. **Data Integrity**: Proper transaction handling prevents partial deletions

### Security Controls

1. **Authorization**:
   - Author-only deletion (configurable)
   - Administrative override capability
   - Session-based security (to be implemented)

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypted data handling
   - Secure deletion of sensitive information
   - Proper error messages without data leakage

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - All deletion attempts logged
   - Distinction between regular and forced deletions
   - Timestamp and user tracking

## Usage

### For End Users

1. **Navigate** to "Schüler finden" (Student Search) page
2. **Locate** the observation you want to delete
3. **Click** the red trash icon next to the observation
4. **Confirm** deletion in the dialog
5. **Review** any error messages and use "Force Delete" if authorized

### For Administrators

- Use the "Force Delete" option when regular deletion fails
- Monitor audit logs for deletion activities
- Handle data protection requests efficiently

## Error Scenarios & Handling

### Common Error Cases

1. **Observation Not Found**
   - **Error**: "Observation with ID {id} not found"
   - **Handling**: Display user-friendly message, prevent deletion attempt

2. **Authorization Failure**
   - **Error**: "Access denied: Only the author can delete this observation"
   - **Handling**: Offer force delete option for administrators

3. **Database Constraints**
   - **Error**: Various database-level errors
   - **Handling**: Transaction rollback, error logging, user notification

### Recovery Mechanisms

- Transaction rollback on failure
- State consistency maintenance
- Clear error messaging with next steps
- Administrative override capabilities

## Implementation Notes

### Current Limitations

1. **User Authentication**: Currently uses hardcoded `author_id = 1`
   - **Recommendation**: Implement proper session management
   - **Impact**: Security risk in multi-user environments

2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Basic author-only verification
   - **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive role system
   - **Impact**: Limited granular permissions

3. **Soft Delete Option**: Currently implements hard delete only
   - **Recommendation**: Consider soft delete for audit trails
   - **Impact**: Cannot recover accidentally deleted observations

### Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Deletion**: Allow multiple observation deletion
2. **Deletion History**: Track deleted observations for audit
3. **Restore Functionality**: Soft delete with restore capability
4. **Advanced Permissions**: Role-based deletion permissions
5. **Deletion Scheduling**: Automated deletion based on retention policies

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Delete observation as author (should succeed)
- [ ] Delete observation as non-author (should fail, offer force delete)
- [ ] Force delete observation (should succeed)
- [ ] Delete non-existent observation (should show appropriate error)
- [ ] Cancel deletion dialog (should not delete)
- [ ] Check audit logs after deletion
- [ ] Verify cascading deletion of attachments
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness during deletion
- [ ] Verify error message display and handling

### Automated Testing

**Recommended Test Cases:**

```rust
// Backend Tests
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_delete_observation_success() { /* ... */ }

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_delete_observation_authorization_failure() { /* ... */ }

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_delete_observation_not_found() { /* ... */ }

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_delete_observation_cascading_attachments() { /* ... */ }
```

```typescript
// Frontend Tests
describe('DeleteObservation', () => {
  test('should show confirmation dialog on delete click', () => {});
  test('should handle successful deletion', () => {});
  test('should handle deletion errors', () => {});
  test('should offer force delete on authorization failure', () => {});
});
```

## Database Schema Impact

### Tables Affected

1. **`observations`** - Primary deletion target
2. **`attachments`** - Cascading deletion (if any exist)

### Migration Requirements

- No schema changes required
- Existing foreign key constraints support cascading deletion
- Audit tables already track deletion operations

## API Reference

### Backend Commands

```rust
// Delete an observation
#[tauri::command]
async fn delete_observation(
    state: tauri::State<'_, AppState>,
    observation_id: i64,
    force_delete: Option<bool>,
) -> Result<(), String>

// Get single observation
#[tauri::command]
async fn get_observation(
    state: tauri::State<'_, AppState>,
    observation_id: i64,
) -> Result<Option<Observation>, String>
```

### Frontend API

```typescript
// Store methods
deleteObservation(observation_id: number, force_delete?: boolean): Promise<void>
getObservation(observation_id: number): Promise<Observation | null>

// Tauri invoke calls
await invoke('delete_observation', { 
  observationId: id, 
  forceDelete: false 
});

await invoke('get_observation', { 
  observationId: id 
});
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Database Backup**: Ensure proper backups before deployment
2. **User Communication**: Inform users about new deletion capabilities
3. **Permission Review**: Verify user permissions align with deletion policies
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for unusual deletion patterns
5. **Training**: Provide administrator training for force delete feature

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot delete" errors**: Check user permissions and force delete option
2. **UI not updating**: Verify frontend state management and error handling
3. **Audit log gaps**: Ensure all deletion paths log appropriately

### Debug Information

- Check audit logs in `audit.db`
- Review application logs for database errors
- Verify network connectivity for API calls
- Test with known good observation IDs
