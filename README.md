## üîÑ Unified Data Synchronization

The system features a **unified synchronization interface** accessible from the main navigation (`/sync`), consolidating all export/import operations for seamless data sharing between devices (e.g., between school notebook and home desktop):

### Enhanced Export Options

**1. Changeset Export** (Recommended for regular sync)
- **Purpose**: Incremental changes only for efficient device synchronization
- **Format**: Binary `.dat` files optimized for sync operations
- **Time Ranges**: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, or **ALL DATA** (unlimited)
- **Use Case**: Regular sync between work devices

**2. Full Export** (Complete database backup)
- **Purpose**: Complete database backup or migration
- **Format**: Structured `.json` files with comprehensive metadata
- **Content**: All students, classes, observations, and device information
- **Use Case**: System backup, data migration, comprehensive transfers

### Export Process
1. **Choose Export Type**: Select Changeset or Full Export based on your needs
2. **Set Data Range**: Choose time period (including unlimited "All Data" option)
3. **Generate File**: System creates appropriate export file with verification
4. **Auto-Download**: File downloads automatically with descriptive filename
5. **Transfer File**: Use USB, email, or network file sharing

### Import Process  
1. **Access Sync Tab**: Navigate to the unified synchronization interface
2. **Select File**: Choose export file using native file dialog
3. **Auto-Detection**: System automatically detects file type and format
4. **Smart Import**: Data is merged with automatic conflict resolution
5. **Complete Refresh**: UI updates to show all imported changes

### Best Practices
- **Regular Exports**: Create backups before major changes
- **Verify Transfers**: Always verify data integrity after import
- **Clean Imports**: Remove temporary files after successful imports
- **Document Changes**: Use built-in audit logs to track all transfers
