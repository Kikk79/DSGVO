# Project Purpose

This is a GDPR-compliant student observation application designed for desktop use. It facilitates secure and local student observation with direct P2P synchronization between devices, eliminating the need for a central server. The application aims for maximum security and performance, adhering to Privacy by Design/Default according to GDPR standards.

**Key Goals:**
- Secure, local student observation.
- Direct device synchronization (Notebook for data capture, Desktop for analysis/reporting).
- P2P synchronization using mTLS, without cloud or central server dependencies.
- Full GDPR compliance, including data encryption, audit logging, data minimization, retention policies, and data subject rights (export, correction, deletion).
